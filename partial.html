    <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">I took ownership of the route optimization
      research prototype, and turned it into a complete software
      package, which continues to serve as the foundation of the RideCo
      product. This included the creation of a test suite, design of
      APIs to interface with other components, and packaging for cloud
      deployment. I was also responsible for the oversight and
      mentoring of the optimization team, contributions to the overall
      system architecture, and leadership in planning activities
      relating to optimization features.</li>

      <li class="itemize">In 2009, the OS kernel assignments for the
      infamous "trains" course that I took as an undergraduate moved
      from x86 to an ARM architecture. Beyond my TA duties, I took
      charge of writing the new material required to update the
      neglected course resources, which included replacing legacy
      code.</li>

      <li class="itemize">Using the official specification and little

      output for the encoder being developed by the hardware team.
      Working together, we discovered and resolved a critical defect in
      their encoder.</li>
