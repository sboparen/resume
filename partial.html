  2016/05</h4>
  <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>I took ownership of the route optimization research prototype,
    and turned it into a complete software package, which continues to
    serve as the foundation of the RideCo product. This included the
    creation of a test suite, design of APIs to interface with other
    components, and packaging for cloud deployment. I was also
    responsible for the oversight and mentoring of the optimization
    team, contributions to the overall system architecture, and
    leadership in planning activities relating to optimization
    features.</li>

  <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-5000" name=
  "x1-5000"></a>Course Support for Real-Time Programming, University of
  Waterloo, 2010/09 - 2012/08</h4>
  <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>In 2009, the OS kernel assignments for the infamous "trains"
    course that I took as an undergraduate moved from x86 to an ARM
    architecture. Beyond my TA duties, I took charge of writing the new
    material required to update the neglected course resources, which
    included replacing legacy code.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-6000" name=
  "x1-6000"></a>Video Codec Programmer Intern, Magnum Semiconductor,
  2008/05-08, 2009/01-04</h4>
  <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>Using the official specification and little else, I was the
    sole developer of a software video encoder for the VC-1 codec. Its
    purpose was to provide a bit-exact reference output for the encoder
    being developed by the hardware team. Working together, we
    discovered and resolved a critical defect in their encoder.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a id="x1-7000" name="x1-7000"></a>3D
  Graphics Programmer Intern, SideFX, 2007/01-04, 2007/09-12</h4>
  <ul style="list-style: none;">
    <li>I was given free reign to tackle the unreliability plaguing the
    tool for performing boolean operations on arbitrary surface
    geometry. After a careful analysis of the existing algorithms, I
    devised and implemented extensive revisions which greatly improved
    numerical stability and the handling of boundary cases.</li>
